# If you don't fill any settings, pymaxd will follow the cube discovery protocol and send the commands to the first cube found.
# If only serial is set, pymaxd will issue a network configuration discovery broadcast for the serial and use the ip address in the response
# If the the address option is set, pymaxd skips the discovery phase and connect directly to the address

# The cube's time config command is somewhat flaky so we don't use it. If you set this option to one of the supported

# Room settings
# For now, maxd supports only a single room to be programmed.
